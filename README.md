# Face_Attendance

This is a face recognition attendance system that was built using python.
It contains three files (main, encode, data)
These three files all have different purposes.
The main file is responsible for turning on the camera and verifying the face and communicating with the database (firebase) if the student is present or not
The encode file is responsible for encoding the pictures of each student thereby making it easier for the main file to do the comparism
The data file is responsible for collecting the data of each unregistered student thereby making them eligible to be recognized by the student.
